Join Expressions
Natural Join
Performs a Cartesian product, filtering consistent tuples.
Removes duplicate attributes.
Requires at least one common attribute between tables.

Inner Join
Default join type (when JOIN is used without OUTER).
Eliminates non-matching tuples.
Equivalent to a natural inner join.

Outer Joins
Returns matched and unmatched values from tables.

Types of outer joins:
LEFT JOIN: Includes unmatched rows from the left table.
RIGHT JOIN: Includes unmatched rows from the right table.
FULL OUTER JOIN: Includes unmatched rows from both tables.




Materialized Views
Stored view relations that are automatically updated when base tables change.
The process is called materialized view maintenance.

View Updates
A view is updatable if:
It selects from a single relation.
The SELECT clause contains only attribute names (no expressions or aggregates).
Non-selected attributes can be set to NULL.
No GROUP BY or HAVING clause is used.

Integrity Constraints
Ensure data consistency by restricting invalid changes to the database.

Types of Constraints:
Entity Integrity Constraints – Ensures unique and non-null primary keys.

Domain Constraints – Limits the type and range of values for attributes.

Referential Integrity Constraints – Maintains relationships between tables.

Key Constraints – Ensures uniqueness for candidate keys.

SQL Data Types and Schemas
Defines the format, storage, and behavior of data.

Data Type Conversion
Explicitly converting data types using CAST:


Large-Object Data Types
Used for storing large data (e.g., images, videos, documents).

Character Large Objects (CLOB) – Stores text.

Binary Large Objects (BLOB) – Stores binary data.

PostgreSQL Large Object Types
BYTEA (<1MB)

TEXT (<1GB)

Large Object (<4TB)

JSONB (<1GB)

XML (<1GB)

User-Defined Data Types
SQL allows defining custom data types for structured storage.

Example: Creating a Dollars type for currency:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TYPE Dollars AS NUMERIC(12,2) FINAL;
Auto-Incrementing Columns
Automatically generate unique IDs.


Size Variations of Auto-Incrementing Types
Type	Size	Range
SMALLSERIAL	2 bytes	1 to 32,767
SERIAL	4 bytes	1 to 2,147,483,647
BIGSERIAL	8 bytes	1 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
Table Creation Extensions
Creating a new table based on an existing schema:
