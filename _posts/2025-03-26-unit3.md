### Topic : Unit 3 

lesson 6

Transaction -it is essentially a single logical unit of work within a database that might involve accessing or modifying its contents.

# ACID Properties

1. Atomicity: Ensures that a transaction is completed fully or not at all.

2. Consistency: Guarantees the database remains consistent before and after the transaction.

3. Isolation: Keeps transactions separate, avoiding interference.

4. Durability: Ensures changes made by a transaction persist even in the event of system failures.

# ACID properties in DBMS

1. Atomicity: The transaction must either complete fully or not at all. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

2. Consistency: Ensures that a database remains in a consistent state before and after a transaction. 

3. Isolation: Multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without interfering with each other.

4. Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent. Even if there's a system crash, the data remains safe.

# History of SQL
SQL, or Structured Query Language, has a fascinating history that dates back to the 1970s. It was originally developed by IBM as part of their System R project
System R  aimed to create a relational database management system

# Parts of SQL
1. Data Definition Language (DDL): Deals with the schema and structure of the database. Examples include CREATE, ALTER, and DROP commands.

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML): Focuses on managing data within the database. Common commands are INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.

3. Integrity: Enforces rules and constraints to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database, like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY.

4. View Definition: Allows users to create and manage views, which are virtual tables based on the result of a query. The CREATE VIEW and DROP VIEW commands fall into this category.

5. Transaction Control: Manages the transactions within the database to ensure ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Commands include COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

6. Embedded SQL and Dynamic SQL:Embedded SQL: SQL code embedded within a host programming language like C or Java.

7. Authorization: Involves assigning permissions and managing security to control access to the database. Commands like GRANT and REVOKE are used for this purpose.

# SQL Data Definition 
refers to the aspect of SQL that deals with defining and managing the structure of a database , some of the main components are
1. Schema Definition
2. types of values
3. integrity constraints
4. indexing
5. security and authorization
6. physical storage structure


# Constraints in SQL
Constraints in SQL are rules that ensure the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the data in a table

# Basic schema defination
A basic schema definition in SQL outlines the structure of a table in a database.

# Basic schema defination
The basic structure of SQL queries involves writing commands to retrieve, manipulate, or manage data in a database.

# database server
A database server is a computer system or application that provides database services to other computers



1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
Used to define and manage database structures like tables, schemas, and indexes.
Common DDL Commands:
CREATE – Creates a new database object (e.g., table, view).
ALTER – Modifies an existing object.
DROP – Deletes an object.
TRUNCATE – Removes all records from a table (faster than DELETE).

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Used to interact with data stored in the database.
Common DML Commands:
SELECT – Retrieves data from a table.
INSERT – Adds new records to a table.
UPDATE – Modifies existing records.
DELETE – Removes records from a table.

3. Data Control Language (DCL)
Manages user access and permissions to the database.
Common DCL Commands:
GRANT – Provides access to database objects.
REVOKE – Removes access from users.

4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
Manages transactions within a database to ensure data integrity.
Common TCL Commands:
COMMIT – Saves all changes made during the transaction.
ROLLBACK – Undoes changes if an error occurs.
SAVEPOINT – Sets a point within a transaction to roll back to if needed.

5. Query Language
Focuses on retrieving and filtering data from the database.
Examples:
WHERE – Filters records based on conditions.
ORDER BY – Sorts query results.
GROUP BY – Groups rows sharing a property.
HAVING – Filters grouped records.


6. Data Query Language (DQL)
Focuses on retrieving data from the database.
Main Command:
SELECT – Extracts information from one or more tables.
Includes clauses like:
WHERE – Filters records.
GROUP BY – Groups records with common values.
ORDER BY – Sorts records.
LIMIT – Restricts the number of records returned.
DISTINCT – Returns unique records.

7. Indexing and Optimization
Improves the speed and performance of database queries.
Common Operations:
CREATE INDEX – Speeds up searches by indexing columns.
DROP INDEX – Removes an index.
Optimization Concepts:
Query Execution Plan – Shows how SQL executes queries.
Normalization – Organizes data to reduce redundancy.
Denormalization – Optimizes queries by reducing joins.

8. Joins and Relationships
Combines data from multiple tables.
Types of Joins:
INNER JOIN – Returns matching records from both tables.
LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN) – Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right.
RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN) – Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left.
FULL OUTER JOIN – Returns all records when there is a match in either table.
CROSS JOIN – Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.

9. Subqueries and Derived Tables
Subquery: A query within a query used to filter or manipulate results.
Types:
Scalar Subquery – Returns a single value.
Correlated Subquery – Depends on the outer query.
Derived Tables – Temporary tables created from subqueries.

10. Views and Materialized Views
Virtual tables derived from SQL queries.
CREATE VIEW – Creates a virtual table from a query.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW – Stores the result of a query for better performance.

11. Stored Procedures and Functions
Reusable SQL code for performing specific tasks.
CREATE PROCEDURE – Defines a stored procedure.
CREATE FUNCTION – Defines a function that returns a value.

12. Triggers
Automatically executes code in response to database events.
CREATE TRIGGER – Defines a trigger to respond to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

13. Common SQL Constraints
Ensures data integrity in tables.

Types of Constraints:
PRIMARY KEY – Uniquely identifies each record.
FOREIGN KEY – Links records between tables.
UNIQUE – Ensures all values in a column are unique.
NOT NULL – Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
CHECK – Enforces custom rules on a column.

14. Window Functions
Performs calculations across rows related to the current row.
Examples:
ROW_NUMBER() – Assigns a unique number to each row.
RANK() – Provides a ranking with gaps for duplicates.
LEAD()/LAG() – Accesses the next/previous row’s value.

15. JSON and XML Handling
Modern SQL supports structured data types like JSON and XML.
Commands:
JSON_EXTRACT() – Retrieves data from JSON fields.
XMLQUERY() – Queries XML data.

# Null value
In SQL, null values represent missing, undefined, or unknown information in a database.

# Arithmetic Operations
If any operand is NULL, the result of the operation is also NULL

# Comparison Operations
Comparing NULL values results in unknown, rather than TRUE or FALSE.

# Aggregate Function
Aggregate functions in SQL are powerful tools used to perform calculations on a set of values, ultimately returning a single result.

# group by clause
The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group rows in a table based on specified columns. It is commonly used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX to perform operations on each group of data.

# the HAVING clause
The HAVING clause in SQL is used to filter groups of data after they have been grouped using the GROUP BY clause.

# date and time manipulation
Date and Time Manipulation in SQL involves operations that work with date and time values, which are crucial for handling temporal data in databases

# output redirection
In SQL, Output Redirection is a technique where the result of a query is not returned to the client (e.g., the terminal) but is instead stored in a new table.

# Nested subqurires
Nested subqueries in SQL are queries within another query, often used to perform complex operations in a single statement
