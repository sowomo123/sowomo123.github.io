🌱Features of Good Relational Designs🌱
Relation for Each Entity: Separate relation per entity; avoid lumping entity attributes.

Minimal Null Values: Plan to minimize nulls; consider breaking up frequent-null attributes into separate tables.

No Spurious Tuples: Use lossless joins to ensure decomposed schemas don't result in invalid joins.

No Redundancy:
Do not repeat data to avoid anomalies.

🌱No Modification Anomalies:🌱
1. Update anomaly: Several copies of same data create inconsistencies.

2. Deletion anomaly: Removing one piece of data removes another by mistake.

3. Insertion anomaly: Can't insert data because associated information is lacking.

Normalization Theory
Goal: Reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
Using decomposition to normal forms without loss of lossless decomposition.

Functional Dependencies (FD)
X → Y means attribute set X determines Y.

1. Closure (F⁺): All FDs logically implied by a set F.
2. Armstrong's Axioms: Axioms to derive all FDs from a set.
3. Reflexivity, Augmentation, Transitivity
4. More: Union, Decomposition, Pseudotransitivity

🦨Canonical Cover🦨
A minimal, equivalent set of functional dependencies.
Eliminates extraneous attributes and redundancies.

Dependency Preservation
Preserves all FDs in the original schema during decomposition.
Used for constraint enforcement without joins.

🦨Normal Forms🦨
1NF: Atomic values only

2NF: No partial dependency (on part of composite key)

3NF: Non-transitive dependencies

BCNF: Stronger than 3NF; every determinant must be a superkey

4NF/5NF: Deal with multivalued and join dependencies

BCNF vs. 3NF
1. BCNF: stronger but can compromise on dependency preservation.

2. 3NF: Restricts loosely, preserves dependency.

Decomposition Algorithms
BCNF Algorithm
Recursively decomposes non-BCNF relations repeatedly.
Lossless but not necessarily dependency-preserving guaranteed.

Complexity: Exponential.

3NF Algorithm🪼
Makes use of canonical cover.
Lossless and dependency-preserving decomposition guaranteed.
Also known as 3NF synthesis, with polynomial-time complexity.

☎️Multivalued Dependencies (MVDs) & 4NF☎️
MVD occurs when attributes are independent of each other but depend on the same primary key.
Even BCNF can leave redundancy if multiple independent multi-valued attributes exist.
A relation is in 4NF if, for every non-trivial MVD X →→ Y, X is a superkey.
Fix: Decompose into separate relations to eliminate redundancy.


✨✨Higher Normal Forms✨✨
5NF (PJNF): Eliminates redundancy caused by join dependencies, which generalize MVDs.
DKNF (Domain-Key Normal Form): Enforces all constraints using only domain and key constraints.
These forms are complex and rarely used in practice due to difficulty in managing constraints.



🔥🔥Atomic Domains & First Normal Form (1NF)🔥🔥
Atomic domains mean each attribute must contain indivisible values.
Violations: Composite attributes (e.g. address), multi-valued attributes (e.g. phone numbers).
1NF Compliance: Break composite/multi-valued attributes into separate fields or relations.

🌈Database Design Process🌈
1. Starts from:
E-R Diagram: Good E-R design reduces need for normalization.
All-in-one schema: Broken down through normalization.
Ad hoc schemas: Iteratively tested and normalized.

2. Design Tips:
Use unique and consistent naming.
Prefer normalized forms unless denormalization improves performance.
Be cautious of designs that obscure time-based or crosstab data.

🪐🪐Modeling Temporal Data🪐🪐
Temporal data: Data valid over time intervals (e.g. address validity, course changes).
Add start_date and end_date to capture valid periods.

Challenges:
Functional dependencies apply only to a time slice.
Primary key includes the valid period to avoid overlap.
Foreign keys must also respect temporal validity.
SQL:2011 introduced basic temporal features like PERIOD FOR, but lacks full temporal joins in most systems.
